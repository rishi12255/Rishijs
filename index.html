          <p>
            With a unique molded upper that was designed to look like the Audi
            TT Roadster, many will remember the Adidas Kobe as the original
            space boots as they were released in 2000.While wearing the Adidas
            The Kobe, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers continued their winning streak
            from the previous year with another NBA Championship win against the
            Philadelphia 76ers.

          <img style="height: 100px; width: 100px" src="2.jpg" />
          <p>
            Released in 2001, the Adidas Kobe 2 was the second installment of
            the space shoes. The shoes were not as sleek or as stylish as the
            previous pair of Adidas Kobe shoes. After beating the New Jersey
            Nets, Kobe Bryant earns a three-peat after winning his third NBA
            Championship at the age of 23. Sadly, the Kobe 2 is the last time
            Kobe would wear Adidas shoes.

          <h2>Kobe 3</h2>
          <img style="height: 100px; width: 100px" src="3.jpg" />
          <p>
            The Nike Kobe 3 is known for its glove-like fit on the upper that
            acts as a second skin on your feet. One famous moment of the Nike
            Kobe 3 is when Kobe Bryant did the double-clutch reverse dunk
            against Chris Paul of the New Orleans Hornets to seal the 2008 MVP
            award.Released between 2007-2008, The Nike Kobe 3 is one of Kobe
            Bryant’s favorite sneakers of all time. It was his pain and misery
            associated with the shoe that made it so special in his eyes.

          <h2>Kobe 4</h2>
          <img style="height: 100px; width: 100px" src="4.jpg" />
          <p>
            The Nike Kobe 4 made its debut in 2008. It was the shoe Kobe wore to
            win his first ring without Shaq. The design was unique because it is
            the first basketball shoe inspired by soccer cleats. Kobe Bryant and
            Nike did commercials for ankle insurance, subverting critics who
            said low-top sneakers didn’t have a place on basketball courts. In
            fact, Kobe Bryant said it himself that his fourth signature sneaker
            was the boldest move that he and Nike have ever done together.The
            gamble paid off, as it dismissed the myth that wearing low-top
            basketball shoes would get you injured. If it weren’t for the Nike
            Kobe 4, we may not have seen low-cut basketball shoes.

          <p>
            The Nike Kobe 5 is the iconic sneaker that Kobe Bryant wore as he
            celebrated his fifth ring after defeating the Boston Celtics in Game
            7 of the 2010 NBA Playoffs in Staples Center, Los Angeles.Compared
            to its predecessor, the Nike Kobe 5 was even lighter and lower,
            pushing the boundaries of basketball shoe technology as Kobe Bryant
            pushed the boundaries of the game.One unique aspect of the shoe is
            the glass/carbon fiber plate in the mid-foot that helps with control
            and rigidity. The Nike Kobe 5 had its fair share of memorable
            releases in colorways like the Bruce Lee and the Chaos. It was first
            introduced somewhere between 2009 and 2010.
